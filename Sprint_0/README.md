# Sprint 0: Python basics & IDE set up
This is the first sprint of this project it’ll cover setting up the coding environment, python basics including syntax, variables, the pythonic way of handling code. and also version control (it goes without saying)
## Objectives
- A professional coding environment ready to use, that have python installed, and the proper tabulation (8).
- Understand the basics of python, from syntax to basic functionalities.
- Version control (git)
- **Code documentation :** since this is my first week, I should be able to document the code following the specific industry best practices, and the pythonic way.
## Milestone
Create a script that prompts the user for several pieces of information (e.g., a noun, an adjective, a verb, a place). Use f-strings to embed these inputs into a pre-written, humorous story template, then print the complete story. Focus on clear prompts and correct variable usage.
## Reflection
Working on this milestone was fun, I learned a lot of things unintentionally from researching, for example:

- bools are sub-class of int, they inherits a lot of int’s functions or methods, `True + True` would output 2.
- `input()` returns `''` an empty string is passed (i.e. no input), when converted to `bool` its `False`.
- type conversion can be implicit (python converts the type, e.g. when adding two numirical vars with different types)or explicit (Dev explicitly convert the type using builtins `str()`, `int()`, ...), a powerful feature.
- f-strings are faster than `‘%’` and `.format()`
- how to type annotate, which is in my opinion a good habit for the long-term.
- triple quotes are not only for docstrings but are mainly for longer formatted string (e.g. an email).
- Mad libs, it was so hilarious to experience with different words.
- `print()` seems simple but it is so powerful, and shows how well python is built.

In summary,  this week was a light more research leaning week, it was fun to mess around with different bultins, the milestone was fun too. I am excited for the sprint.

*see you there! future me probably, or the archiving bots.*
